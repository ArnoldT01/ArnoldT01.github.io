        <section class="about-me" id="about-me">
            <p class="short-intro">Full Stack .NET Engineer with a passion for building robust, scalable applications. Focused on clean architecture, performance, and seamless user experiences. I also love volunteering my skills to help others through tech.</p>
            
            <button class="collapsible">Background</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Ever since I can remember, I’ve been curious about how people interact with the world around them especially through technology. That curiosity grew into a passion for creating digital experiences that are both functional and user-friendly. As a Full Stack Developer with over a year of formal experience and more than five years of hands-on tinkering and self-driven learning, I enjoy building end-to-end solutions that bring ideas to life. I combine problem-solving with clean, efficient code to deliver seamless web applications.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="collapsible">Engineering Philosophy</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>As an engineer, I believe in creating thoughtful, user-centered solutions by focusing on clarity, scalability, and maintainability from the start. My process begins with a <b>mobile-first mindset</b>, ensuring that every experience is accessible and optimized for the devices people actually use. By starting with constraints, I’m able to design lean, performance-oriented interfaces that scale naturally to larger screens. Good design should serve the user first—and mobile-first development helps keep that priority clear.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I practice <b>agile development</b> with a strong emphasis on iteration and collaboration. I believe that progress is best achieved through small, incremental changes, validated by feedback and guided by clear goals. I integrate testing at every level—unit, integration, and end-to-end—to catch issues early and ensure reliability. To me, testing isn’t just about preventing bugs, but about building confidence in code and enabling fast, fearless deployments.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Underlying it all is a commitment to clean, well-structured <b>architecture</b>. Whether I’m designing APIs, managing state, or structuring front-end components, I strive to build systems that are modular, predictable, and easy to extend. I see engineering as a craft that balances speed with quality, innovation with stability. Every line of code is part of a larger system, and my goal is always to contribute in a way that’s thoughtful, robust, and human-centered.</p>
            </div>

            <button class="collapsible">Things I Love</button>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I find inspiration in the everyday world and the technologies that shape it. When I’m not coding, I’m probably diving into the year’s best sci-fi films, exploring immersive game worlds, or hunting down the best coffee spots in town. I'm a passionate movie enthusiast, an avid gamer who enjoys both competitive and story-driven titles, and a self-proclaimed coffee connoisseur. I also love experimenting with new technologies—whether it's a new framework or a fresh API, I'm always building side projects just for the fun of it.</p>
